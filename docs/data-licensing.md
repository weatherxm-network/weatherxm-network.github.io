# WeatherXM Data Licensing and Usage

## Commercial Use

In order to establish a price discovery mechanism, and allow teams to invest, innovate and
build on top of the WeatherXM Dataset, we will auction four licenses that allow their holders
to use our dataset commercially.

::: info Current License Holders

[The 2026 Data License Auction has ended](https://paragraph.com/@weatherxm/two-winners-for-2026-data-licenses). 

The following organizations hold commercial data licenses for 2026:
- **WeatherXM AG** (Zug, Switzerland)
- **Zeus Bittensor Subnet** (ORPHEUS AI B.V., Netherlands)

:::

More specifically, the WeatherXM Network Association will auction four (4) licenses every year:

1. Licensees will get **the right to use the full WeatherXM Dataset commercially.**   
Commercial uses include building and selling value-added services, selling access to the data set for the duration of the license, selling the data through a REST API, building B2B or B2C services that integrate the data, using the data in proprietary weather models.
2. **The duration of each license is one year (January 1, to December 31).**   
The licensee can not make commercial use of the data after the license has expired.
3. In November of the previous year, the Association BoD defines and advertises the minimum bid and the auction follows.
4. The auction taks place off-chain. Bidders must email ga@weatherxm.network with the amount of $WXM and proof (link to address on arbiscan) that they already hold the amount at the time of the bid. The association will make all bids received public.
5. The four licenses will be awarded to the four (4) highest bidders at the end of the auction. This is an English type, open bid auction.

### Special provisions for 2024:
- 2024 licenses will be auctioned 30 days after station rewards appear on the Arbitrum mainnet. The duration of the auction will be 15 days.

## Non-commercial use

We believe that the value of the WeatherXM dataset extends much further than their commercial use.
The commercial licenses awarded through auction will not limit non-commercial uses of the Network’s data. 

**Non-commercial, personal use is and will always be free and permissionless.**

Academic use of the Network’s data will be in most cases free, but we require the institution intending to use the data to contact
us first (license@weatherxm.network) and get approval.
