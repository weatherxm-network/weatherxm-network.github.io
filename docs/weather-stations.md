# Hardware manufacturers and hardware diversity

Our vision is an open Network where stations from mutiple manufatcturers participate.

## Specifications

To ensure Network-wide device and data quality, all devices (weather stations) that
participate in the WeatherXM Network must be approved by the Association.


In this direction, the Association:
- will publish the required station specifications and,
- will establish an approval process for hardware manufacturers.

## Onboarding fees

Manufacturers must pay an onboarding fee of $100 to the Association for every station (device) manufatctured.

The Association makes periodic announcements about the fees collected on [our blog](https://paragraph.xyz/@weatherxm/3):

- 2024-06-16: [$350,000 worth of onboarding fees collected in Q3 2024](https://paragraph.xyz/@weatherxm/350,000-worth-of-onboarding-fees-collected-in-q3-2024)
- 2024-06-06: [$300,000 worth of onboarding fees collected](https://paragraph.xyz/@weatherxm/300k-onboarding-fees)

::: info Pre-association weather stations
As of the end of 2023, there were 7,795 weather stations participating in the WeatherXM Network.
These devices were designed and manufactured by WeatherXM AG and partner company EXM PC, before the Association was formed, and have been granted
approval by default.
